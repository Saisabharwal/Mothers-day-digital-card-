<h1> Happy Mothers Day Vas The Boss!</h1>

<h3>Welcome to your digital mothers day card</h3>

    <p>Over the past few years on mothers day id use a skill ive learnt to make a card for you, one year it was an oragami card the other years it was also oragami cards LOL. Something ive also noticed in Sree, he crotchet'd you a coaster and made everything by hand. At first I was planning on using the $40 in my account to buy you something cheap off amazon but when dad was yelling at me to learn to code it gave me this idea. I did some research and the fastest way to make a website without using website making tools such as wix and google sites was to learn the first little bit of HTML. Once I learned the first few basic tags I was able to create this for you.  </p>
